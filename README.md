Corporacion Favorita is an Ecuador-based grocery retailer that operates hundreds of supermarkets and carries over 200,000 items. At the time, the business relied on subjective forecasting methods backed by little data analytics.  Through this competition, they challenge data scientists to develop innovative, data-driven solutions that can ultimately improves their sales forecasts.
